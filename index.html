		Welcome to this cozy little homepage!
		Appisode is merely an alias for myself, someone who develops all sorts of stuff, be it web applications, chess games, informational sites or mobile apps.
		As long as it's interactive.
		<h1>Brief Biography</small></h1>
		I'm Tobias Sytsma, a ..age(1997/08/19)-year-old app fanatic. I like building apps because they are available to lots of people around the world once published. They can be a major addition to people's lives. Or just a handy time-saver. At any rate, apps can be of great importance to people, and that's what inspires me to come up with and realise new apps.
